# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Mobile Dataset

Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a mobile dataset using Python. The goal is to understand the dataset, detect patterns, and gain insights that can be useful for further analysis or machine learning models.

 
Requirements

Before running the analysis, install the required dependencies:

 
Steps for EDA

1. Load the Dataset

 2. Understand the Data

Get a basic understanding of the dataset:

   First few rows
   Column details
   Summary statistics

3. Handle Missing Values & Duplicates

   Check for missing values
   Remove duplicate rows
   Fill missing values

4. Univariate Analysis (Single Variable)

 
5. Bivariate Analysis (Relationships Between Features)

  
6. Categorical Analysis





Advanced Visualizations: Pairplots, violin plots, and more

Conclusion

This EDA helps in understanding the trends in the mobile dataset, identifying key factors affecting pricing, and preparing the dataset for further predictive modeling.
